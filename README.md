The given data set
==================================================================
It is given the HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING SMARTPHONES DATA
SET, experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers which are
randomly partitioned into two groups: 70% for training and 30% for 
test. Each person perform six different activities wearing a 
smartphone. Device sensors as accelerometer and gyroscope are 
generating data which are grouped, after digital filtering, in 
variables named features. Detailed information about the each 
record, given files, and additional notes can be found in the 
README.txt file incluided in the data set. 

How the script is connected and works
==================================================================
1. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.
==================================================================
a) Read the test, training and subject data sets for x and y into R
   and determine its dimension. Use the read.csv() and dim() functions.
   Next, the generated variables and their dimensions:

    test.x			      [2947 x 561]
  	test.y			      [2947 x 1]
  	test.subject		  [2947 x 1]
  	training.x        [7352 x 561]
  	training.y		    [7352 x 1]
  	training.subject	[7352 x 1]	

b) Merge the test.x with the training.x to create data.x. The same 
   for y and subject to create data.y and data.subject. Use rbind() 
   function. Next, the generated variables and their dimensions:

  	data.x			  [10299 x 561]
  	data.y			  [10299 x 1]
  	data.s			  [10299 x 1]

c) Merge data.x, data.y, and data.s to create one data set using 
   the data.frame() function. The variable y its dimensions:

  	data.set		[10299 x 563]

d) data.s belong to the total number of volunteers. It is confirmed
   by the analysis of data.s, using the unique() function. It means, 
   data.s has 30 unique elements:

	  elements.s		[30 x 1]

e) data.y belong to the total number of activities. It is confirmed
   by the analysis of data.y, using the unique() function; it means,
   data.y has 6 unique elements:

  	elements.y		[6 x 1]

f) data.x belong to the total data generated by the device sensors 
   in their 561 variables. The name of those variables is given in 
   the features file and it will be used to name the columns. 

	  features		[561 x 2]

   This data set has a additional index wich will be used by select
   the mean and standard-deviation variables.

   After the completion of the one data set (data.set) and the analysis
   of its companents, it is ready to name columns and rows in descriptive
   names. 

	  data.set		[10299 x 563]

   The data set "data.set" has 10299 measurement and 563 columns; 
   561 for sensing variables, one for Volunteer, and one for Activity,  

==================================================================
2. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
==================================================================
g) Columns names are given in the features.txt. It contains the 561 
   variables names. Extract the column name and add the two names for 
   the Volunter and Activity columns that were added in f) using the 
   append() function. Change the name of the columns using colnames().

h) Rows names for the descriptive activities are given in the 
   activity_labels.txt file. Casting the column Activity as factor, 
   the row activities are named in descriptive way. 


==================================================================
3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
   for each measurement.
==================================================================

i) Generate a "index" to extract columns with mean and standard 
   deviation. Use the grepl() function into the features data 
   frame used in f) setting as pattern the words "mean" and "std".
   In features, there are 79 variables belonging to mean and 
   standard desviation:

	  mean.std.colnames	[79 x 2]

j) In the index, consider that two columns have been added for the 
   "Volunteer" and ""Activity" variables. So, index has 81 elements;
   79 belonging to the sensing data, one for Volunteer and one for
   Activity. 
	
  	index			[1 x 81]

k) Subset the data.set to generate a data set only containing the 
   mean and standard deviation measurements. Use the subset() function.
   The subset data containts the original 10299 measurements and the 
   79 sensing variables belonging to the mean and standard deviation
   plus the volunteers and activities columns:

	  ds.mean.sd		[10299 x 81] 


==================================================================
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variables names.
==================================================================

l) The volunter and activities is appropiately labeled to facilitate
   its understanding for human being and to generate a tidy data in 
   the next step. It is used the paste() function to fusioned each
   volunter with his/her developed activity.

==================================================================
5. From the data, create a tidy data set.
==================================================================

k) using the aggregate() function, it is created a tidy data set which 
   contains the average of each variable for each activity and each 
   subject. The tidy data has 180 rows belonging to the 30 volunteers
   and six activities each one. Each row is the average of its 
   measurements. It also contains 80 columns: 79 for the sensing 
   variables and one for volunter and one activities:

  	tidy			[180 x 81]
